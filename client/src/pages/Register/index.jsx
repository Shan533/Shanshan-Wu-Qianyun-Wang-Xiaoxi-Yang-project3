 * For existing users, you should provide a way for users to log in.  
 * If the password does not match the username, the password is empty,
 *  the username is empty or the username does not exist,
 *  then you should provide an error message letting the user know what has happened.

 * Once a user has logged in, either by creating an account or logging in to an existing account, 
 * they should be redirected to their password manager page.

 * We will be using cookies to track user sessions and delete those cookies when a user logs out. 
 * This will all happen in the backend.
